# Crime Face Detector

Thanks to a detailed dataset of ~70,000 criminal mugshots provided by the [Illinois State Department of Corrections](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/davidjfisher/illinois-doc-labeled-faces-dataset?resource=download), we can harness the powers of AI and machine learning to determine what crimes you will be most likely to commit, based on your facial features.

Ideally this will be used whenever you open your phone with facial recognition _(and immediately forward the results to your nearest law enforcement agency)_, or before boarding planes.

This should be sold to the government, so we can preemptively arrest criminals, like yourself.
